# 6.0更新
Index templates now take an list for the template: field instead of a string.

For example:

{
  "index_patterns":  ["c*", "d*"],
}
Instead of the previous form

{
  "template": "c*"
}
Template metadata from older versions of ES are still openable with this code, although I don't know how important that is since it's probably assumed that you can't just open a new elasticsearch release on an old one's data directory and expect it to work.
